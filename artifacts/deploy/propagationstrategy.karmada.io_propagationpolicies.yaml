                                  DoesNotExist, the values array must be empty. This
                                  array is replaced during a strategic merge patch.

                            A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent
                            to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is
                            "key", the operator is "In", and the values array contains
                            only "value". The requirements are ANDed.
