                                          This may be any object from a non-empty

                                          fields are non-empty, they must have the
                                          same value. For backwards compatibility,
                                          when namespace isn''t specified in dataSourceRef,
                                          both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef)
                                          will be set to the same value automatically
                                          if one of them is empty and the other is
                                          non-empty. When namespace is specified in

                                          the same value and must be empty. There
                                          are three important differences between
                                          dataSource and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource
                                          only allows two specific types of objects,
                                          dataSourceRef allows any non-core object,
                                          as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                          * While dataSource ignores disallowed values
                                          (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves
                                          all values, and generates an error if a
                                          disallowed value is specified. * While dataSource
                                          only allows local objects, dataSourceRef
                                          allows objects in any namespaces. (Beta)
                                          Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource

                          version of Kubernetes. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-controller-manager/
                          for details. \n However, Karmada uses Kubernetes Native
                          API definitions for federated resource template, so it doesn't
                          need enable some resource related controllers like daemonset,
                          deployment etc. On the other hand, Karmada leverages the
                          capabilities of the Kubernetes controller to manage the
                          lifecycle of the federated resource, so it needs to enable
                          some controllers. For example, the `namespace` controller
                          is used to manage the lifecycle of the namespace and the
                          `garbagecollector` controller handles automatic clean-up
                          of redundant items in your karmada. \n According to the
                          user feedback and karmada requirements, the following controllers
                          are enabled by default: namespace, garbagecollector, serviceaccount-token,
                          ttl-after-finished, bootstrapsigner,csrapproving,csrcleaner,csrsigning.
                          See https://karmada.io/docs/administrator/configuration/configure-controllers#kubernetes-controllers
                          \n Others are disabled by default. If you want to enable
                          or disable other controllers, you have to explicitly specify
                          all the controllers that kube-controller-manager should
                          enable at startup phase."
