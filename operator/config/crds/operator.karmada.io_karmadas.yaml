                                          dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                          volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                          core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                          When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                          the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                          provisioner.
                                          This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                          if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                          compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                          both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                          value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                          When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                          dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                          There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                          * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                            allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                          * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                            preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                            specified.
                                          * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                            in any namespaces.
                                          (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                          (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                    Must be a filesystem type supported by the host operating system.
                                    Examples: "ext4", "xfs", "ntfs". Implicitly inferred to be "ext4" if unspecified.

                                ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                and deleted when the pod is removed.


                                Use this if:
                                a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                   tracking are needed,
                                c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                   a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                   information on the connection between this volume type
                                   and PersistentVolumeClaim).


                                Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                of an individual pod.


                                Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                more information.


                                A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                persistent volumes at the same time.
                              properties:
                                volumeClaimTemplate:

                                    Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                    The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                    owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                    pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                    `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                    entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                    is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).


                                    An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                    will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                    volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                    the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                    meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                    owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                    this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                    manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                    to the PVC after it has been created.

                                            dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                            volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                            core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                            When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                            the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                            provisioner.
                                            This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                            if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                            compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                            both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                            value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                            When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                            dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                            There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                            * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                              allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                            * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                              preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                              specified.
                                            * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                              in any namespaces.
                                            (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                            (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                          However, Karmada uses Kubernetes Native API definitions for federated resource template,
                          so it doesn't need enable some resource related controllers like daemonset, deployment etc.
                          On the other hand, Karmada leverages the capabilities of the Kubernetes controller to
                          manage the lifecycle of the federated resource, so it needs to enable some controllers.
                          For example, the `namespace` controller is used to manage the lifecycle of the namespace
                          and the `garbagecollector` controller handles automatic clean-up of redundant items in
                          your karmada.


                          According to the user feedback and karmada requirements, the following controllers are
                          enabled by default: namespace, garbagecollector, serviceaccount-token, ttl-after-finished,
                          bootstrapsigner,csrapproving,csrcleaner,csrsigning. See
                          https://karmada.io/docs/administrator/configuration/configure-controllers#kubernetes-controllers


                          Others are disabled by default. If you want to enable or disable other controllers, you
                          have to explicitly specify all the controllers that kube-controller-manager should enable
                          at startup phase.

                          without leading dash(es).


                          Note: This is a temporary solution to allow for the configuration of the
                          kube-controller-manager component. In the future, we will provide a more structured way
                          to configure the component. Once that is done, this field will be discouraged to be used.
                          Incorrect settings on this field maybe lead to the corresponding component in an unhealthy
                          state. Before you do it, please confirm that you understand the risks of this configuration.
