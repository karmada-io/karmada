# What's New
## Aggregated Kubernetes API Endpoint
The newly introduced `karmada-aggregated-apiserver` component aggregates all registered clusters and allows users to 
access member clusters through Karmada by the proxy endpoint, e.g.

- Retrieve `Node` from `member1`:  /apis/cluster.karmada.io/v1alpha1/clusters/member1/proxy/api/v1/nodes
- Retrieve `Pod` from `member2`: /apis/cluster.karmada.io/v1alpha1/clusters/member2/proxy/api/v1/namespaces/default/pods
  Please refer to user guide for more details.
  

## Promoting Workloads from Legacy Clusters to Karmada
Legacy workloads running in Kubernetes now can be promoted to Karmada smoothly without container restart.
In favor of `promote` commands added to Karmada CLI, any kind of Kubernetes resources can be promoted to Karmada easily, e.g.

```shell
# Promote deployment(default/nginx) from cluster1 to Karmada
kubectl karmada promote deployment nginx -n default -c cluster1
```


## Verified Integration with Ecosystem
Benefiting from the Kubernetes native API support, Karmada can easily integrate the single cluster ecosystem for multi-cluster, 
multi-cloud purpose. The following components have been verified by the Karmada community:

- argo-cd: refer to [working with argo-cd](../working-with-argocd.md)
- Flux: refer to [propagating helm charts with flux](https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/issues/861#issuecomment-998540302)
- Istio: refer to [working with Istio](../working-with-istio-on-flat-network.md)
- Filebeat: refer to [working with Filebeat](../working-with-filebeat.md)
- Submariner: refer to [working with Submariner](../working-with-submariner.md)
- Velero: refer to [working with Velero](../working-with-velero.md)
- Prometheus: refer to [working with Prometheus](../working-with-prometheus.md)


## OverridePolicy Improvements
By leverage of the new-introduced `RuleWithCluster` fields to `OverridePolicy` and `ClusterOverridePolicy`, users are now 
able to define override policies with a single policy for specified workloads.

## Karmada Installation Improvements
Introduced `init` command to `Karmada CLI`. Users are now able to install Karmada by a single command.

Please refer to [Installing Karmada](../installation/installation.md) for more details.


## Configuring Karmada Controllers
Now all controllers provided by Karmada work as plug-ins. Users are now able to turn off any of them from the default 
enabled list.

See `--controllers` flag of `karmada-controller-manager` and `karmada-agent` for more details.


## Resource Interpreter Webhook Enhancement
Introduced `ReviseReplica` support for the `Resource Interpreter Webhook` framework, which enables scheduling all 
customized workloads just like Kubernetes native ones.

Refer to [Resource Interpreter Webhook Proposal](../proposals/resource-interpreter-webhook/README.md) for more design details.
