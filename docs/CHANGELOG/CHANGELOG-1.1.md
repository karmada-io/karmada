# What's New
## Multi-Cluster Ingress
The newly introduced [MultiClusterIngress](https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/blob/d6355ec85296daa46ed344cade6ef10a9bee58dc/pkg/apis/networking/v1alpha1/ingress_types.go#L16) 
API exposes HTTP and HTTPS routes that target multi-cluster services within the Karmada control plane. The specification 
of `MultiClusterIngress` is compatible with [Kubernetes Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/).

Traffic routing is controlled by rules defined on the MultiClusterIngress resource, an MultiClusterIngress controller is
responsible for fulfilling the ingress. The [Multi-Cluster-Nginx Ingress Controller](https://github.com/karmada-io/multi-cluster-ingress-nginx) 
is one of the MultiClusterIngress controller implementations maintained by the community.


## Federated ResourceQuota
The newly introduced [FederatedResourceQuota](https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/blob/master/pkg/apis/policy/v1alpha1/federatedresourcequota_types.go#L14)
provides constraints that limit total resource consumption per namespace `across all clusters`. 
It can limit the number of objects that can be created in a namespace by type, as well as the total amount of compute 
resources that may be consumed by resources in that namespace.


## Configurability improvement for performance tuning
The default number of reconciling workers has been enlarged and configurable. A larger number of workers means higher 
responsiveness but heavier CPU and network load. The number of concurrent workers could be configured by the flags 
introduced to `karmada-controller-manager` and `karmada-agent`.

Flags introduced to `karmada-controller-manager`:

- `--concurrent-work-syncs`
- `--concurrent-namespace-syncs`
- `--concurrent-resource-template-syncs`
- `--concurrent-cluster-syncs`
- `--concurrent-clusterresourcebinding-syncs`
- `--concurrent-resourcebinding-syncs`

Flags introduced to `karmada-agent`:

- `--concurrent-work-syncs`
- `--concurrent-cluster-syncs`


## Resource Interpreter Webhook Enhancement
Introduced `AggregateStatus` support for the `Resource Interpreter Webhook` framework, which enables customized resource status aggregating.

Introduced `InterpreterOperationInterpretDependency` support for the `Resource Interpreter Webhook` framework, 
which enables propagating workload's dependencies automatically.

Refer to [Customizing Resource Interpreter](../userguide/customizing-resource-interpreter.md) for more details.
