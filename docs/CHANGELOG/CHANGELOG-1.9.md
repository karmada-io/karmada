## What's New

### Lazy mode of PropagationPolicy

The PropgationPolicy now supports lazy mode that can delay the activation of modification. In contrast to the default behavior, modifications to the PropagationPolicy will not immediately trigger scheduling and redistribute the workload but will be delayed until changes happen on workloads themselves. It will be useful in using global PropagationPolicy to manage huge amounts of workloads.

The ability also applies to ClusterPropagationPolicy and it is disabled by default for backward compatibility, users need to enable it explicitly by specifying the `activationPreference` in PropagationPolicy or ClusterPropagationPolicy.

See [Proposal of the LazyActivation preference for Policy](https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/blob/master/docs/proposals/scheduling/activation-preference/lazy-activation-preference.md) for more details.

### Cluster condition-based remedy system

The applications running within a cluster may be disrupted by cluster failures, it's an effective practice to deploy applications across multiple clusters, by leveraging load balancers that can route business traffic simultaneously to these clusters.

This release introduced an automated healing capability based on the health status of clusters. It relies on a third-party system to identify cluster failures and report through Conditions of a Cluster object, with the remedy capability, Karmada can take predefined actions according to the reported cluster failures. This can be used to prevent business traffic from the failure cluster, and thus can enhance availability by promptly responding to and mitigating the impact of cluster failures.

(Feature contributor: @XiShanYongYe-Chang)

### Scheduler Estimator Enhancements

The Karmada Scheduler Estimator introduced a plugin that takes resource quota into account during the estimation process.
It is in alpha state and controlled by the feature gate `ResourceQuotaEstimate`, once this feature is enabled, the Karmada Scheduler Estimator can estimate the number of workload replicas based on resource quota.

(Feature contributors: @wengyao04)

## Other Notable Changes
### API Changes
- Introduced `ActivationPreference` to the `PropagationPolicy` and `ClusterPropagationPolicy` to indicate how the referencing resource template will be propagated, in case of policy changes. ([#4577](https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/pull/4577), @chaosi-zju)
