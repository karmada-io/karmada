## Urgent Update Notes
- The Karmada Lua interpreter will no longer support the Lua functions `string.rep` and `string.gsub`. Typically, these functions are not
  frequently used in custom Karmada resource interpreters. They are disabled due to potential security risks. Before upgrading, please review
  your Lua scripts to verify whether these functions are being used. If they are, please replace them with alternative implementations.

## What's New

### Application Priority Scheduling

In some real-world scenarios, like AI training, some jobs are more critical than others and require preferential treatment in terms of scheduling and resource allocation. To enhance support for the above scenarios, this release karmada introduces the application priority scheduling feature, which allows users to set the priority of applications to control the order of application scheduling. Applications with higher priority will be scheduled ahead of other applications with lower priority. 

With this feature, users can:

- Classify workloads based on priority to achieve that high-priority workloads are scheduled ahead of others, rather than waiting to be scheduled in the order they were queued.  This will allow users to maintain the quality of service for important workloads even during resource contention.
- Set a higher priority for AI training tasks, ensuring that they can use GPU resources preferentially and guaranteeing the normal progress of AI training tasks.

For a detailed description of this feature, see the [Proposal: Binding Priority and Preemption](https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/tree/master/docs/proposals/scheduling/binding-priority-preemption)

(Feature contributors: @whitewindmills, @LeonZh0u, @seanlaii, @wengyao04, @zclyne)

### Support for resource scheduling suspend and resume capabilities

Resource propagation in Karmada can be simply understood as two phases, resource scheduling and resource propagation. The propagation phase could already be flexibly [suspended and resumed](https://karmada.io/docs/next/userguide/scheduling/resource-propagating/#suspend-and-resume-of-resource-propagation) by users, a 
feature introduced in release v1.11. Now, the scheduling phase also has this feature.

By expanding the `ResourceBinding.ResourceBindingSpec.Spec.Suspension` field, users gain control over the suspension and resumption of scheduling. This enhancement opens up opportunities for external controllers to implement more advanced functionalities. For example:

- It helps in multi-tenancy scenarios, enabling priority control for different tenants. A cluster administrator can perform workload sorting and other operations on the upper layer, and resume scheduling if the sorting is completed.

- Quota checks are also possible during scheduling. Workloads will be dispatched only when the tenant resources are sufficient. Otherwise, the workload will be suspended for scheduling to achieve multi-tenant quota control.

For a detailed description of this feature, see the [Proposal: Support for resource scheduling suspend and resume capabilities](https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/tree/master/docs/proposals/scheduling-suspension)

(Feature contributors: @Vacant2333, @Monokaix)

### Karmada Operator Continuous Enhancement

This release continues to enhance the Karmada Operator, which is responsible for managing the lifecycle of Karmada components. The following features are added:

- Support for API Server sidecar in Karmada Operator: This feature allows users to customize the Karmada API server container with sidecar containers, enabling users to integrate auxiliary services such as KMS plugins for configuring encryption at rest. For more information, see the [Proposal: Add Support for API Server Sidecar Containers in Karmada Operator](https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/tree/master/docs/proposals/karmada-operator/api-server-sidecard-containers)
- Support for Component Priority Class Configuration in Karmada Operator: This feature allows users to configure the priority class for Karmada control plane components in the Karmada CR, ensuring reliable resource allocation and system stability across workloads. For more information, see the [Proposal: Support Priority Class Configuration for Karmada Control Plane Components](https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/tree/master/docs/proposals/karmada-operator/component-priority-class-name)

These enhancements allow karmada-operator to be more flexible and customizable, enhancing the overall karmada system reliability and stability.

### Remarkable Performance Optimization of the Karmada Controllers

As Karmada is being adopted by an increasing number of vendors and the deployment scale is growing larger, the performance optimization of Karmada has become a top priority. Karmada adopters spontaneously organize themselves to optimize the performance of Karmada, and achieved remarkable results.

In this release, the performance optimization of Karmada mainly centers around the controllers. The primary focus is to address the issue where the detector and binding-controller consume a significant amount of time during component restarts or master switches in large-scale data scenarios.

To address this, in v1.13, we carried out systematic performance optimizations. Testing was done on a 12C CPU, 28G RAM physical machine with 1000 deployments and 1000 configmaps (2000 resourceBindings). After restarting karmada-controller-manager, workqueue metrics showed significant improvements:
For detector: Element Average Processing Time(1-minute Sampling Period) Peak from 2.96s to 1.74s (41.22% reduction), total queue-clear time decreased by 60%, and peak-to-clear time decreased by 33.33%.
For binding-controller: Element Average Processing Time(1-minute Sampling Period) Peak from 1.98s to 0.96s (51.72% reduction), total queue-clear time decreased by 25%, and peak-to-clear time also decreased by 25%.

These data prove that the performance of these two controllers has been greatly enhanced in v1.13. In the future, we will continue to carry out systematic performance optimizations on the controllers and the scheduler.

### Release of the First Version of the Karmada Dashboard

With the continuous efforts of several enthusiastic developers, karmada dashboard finally welcomes its milestone first version (v0.1.0)! This version marks a significant step forward in the visual management of Karmada.

Karmada Dashboard is a general-purpose, web-based control panel for Karmada which is a multi-cluster management project. It aims to simplify the operation process of multi-cluster management and enhance the user experience. Through the Dashboard, users can intuitively view the cluster status, resource distribution, and task execution status. At the same time, users can also easily complete configuration adjustments and policy deployments.

The main features of this version include:
- Cluster Management: It provides cluster access and an overview of the cluster status, including health status and nodes number.
- Resource Management: It manages the configuration of business resources, covering namespaces, workloads, services, etc.
- Policy Management: It conducts the management of Karmada policies, including propagation policies, override policies, etc.

For a detailed description and usage guide, see the [Karmada Dashboard](https://github.com/karmada-io/dashboard)

## Downloads for v1.13.0-beta.0

Download v1.13.0-beta.0 in the [v1.13.0-beta.0 release page](https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/releases/tag/v1.13.0-beta.0).

## Changelog since v1.13.0-alpha.2

## Urgent Update Notes
- The Karmada Lua interpreter will no longer support the Lua functions `string.rep` and `string.gsub`. Typically, these functions are not 
frequently used in custom Karmada resource interpreters. They are disabled due to potential security risks. Before upgrading, please review 
your Lua scripts to verify whether these functions are being used. If they are, please replace them with alternative implementations.

### Security
- `karmada-controller-manager`: For security reasons, we made the following changes to restrict the string library functions used when users customize the Karmada Lua interpreter. ([#6087](https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/pull/6087), @zhzhuang-zju)
  1. do not allow users to use string.gsub and string.rep when interpreting resources with lua scripts, which may be used to create overly long strings.
  2. limit the length of the string type parameters of the function to 1000,000.
  3. add timeout checks to the internal for loops within the functions.
