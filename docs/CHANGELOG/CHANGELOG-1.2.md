## Karmada v1.2 Release Notes

### What's New
#### Significant improvement on scheduling capability and scalability
##### 1. Karmada Descheduler
A new component `karmada-descheduler` was introduced, for rebalancing the scheduling decisions over time.
   
One example use case is: it helps evict pending replicas (Pods) from resource-starved clusters so that `karmada-scheduler`
can "reschedule" these replicas (Pods) to a cluster with sufficient resources.

For more details please refer to [Descheduler user guide.](../../docs/descheduler.md)


##### 2. Multi region HA support
By leveraging the newly added `spread-by-region` constraint, users are now able to deploy workloads across `regions`, 
e.g. people may want their workloads always running on different regions for HA purposes.

We also introduced two plugins to `karmada-scheduler`, which add to accurate scheduling.

- `ClusterLocality` is a scoring plugin that favors clusters already assigned.
- `SpreadConstraint` is a filter plugin that filters clusters as per spread constraints.

We are also in the progress of enhancing the multi-cluster failover mechanism. Part of the work has been included in this release.
For example:

- A new flag(`--cluster-failure-threshold`) has been added to both `karmada-controller-manager` and `karmada-agent`, 
  which specifies the cluster failure threshold (defaults to 30s). A cluster will be considered `not-ready` 
  only when it stays unhealthy longer than supposed.
- A new flag(`--failover-eviction-timeout`) has been added to `karmada-controller-manager`, which specifies the grace period 
  of eviction (defaults to 5 minutes). If a cluster stays `not-ready` longer than supposed, the controller taints the cluster. 
  (Note: The taint is essentially the eviction order and the implementation is planned for the next release.)


#### Fully adopted aggregated API
The `Aggregated API` was initially introduced in Release 1.0, which allows users to access clusters through Karmada by 
a single aggregated API endpoint. By leveraging this feature, we introduced a lot of interesting features to `karmadactl` and `kubectl-karmada`.

1. The get sub-command now supports clusters both in push and pull mode.
```shell
# karmadactl get deployment -n default
NAME      CLUSTER   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE     ADOPTION
nginx     member1   2/2     2            2           33h     N
nginx     member2   1/1     1            1           4m38s   Y
podinfo   member3   2/2     2            2           27h     N
```
2. The newly added logs command prints the container logs in a specific cluster.
```shell
# ./karmadactl logs nginx-6799fc88d8-9mpxn -c nginx  -C member1
/docker-entrypoint.sh: /docker-entrypoint.d/ is not empty, will attempt to perform configuration
/docker-entrypoint.sh: Looking for shell scripts in /docker-entrypoint.d/
/docker-entrypoint.sh: Launching /docker-entrypoint.d/10-listen-on-ipv6-by-default.sh
10-listen-on-ipv6-by-default.sh: info: Getting the checksum of /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
...
```

3. We also added `watch` and `exec` commands to `karmadactl`, in addition to `get` and `logs`. They all use the aggregated API.


#### Distributed search and analytics engine for Kubernetes resources (`alpha`)
The newly introduced `karmada-search` caches resources in clusters and allows users to search for resources without directly touching real clusters.

```shell
# kubectl get --raw /apis/search.karmada.io/v1alpha1/search/cache/apis/apps/v1/deployments
{
	"apiVersion": "v1",
	"kind": "List",
	"metadata": {},
	"items": [{
		"apiVersion": "apps/v1",
		"kind": "Deployment",
		"metadata": {
			"annotations": {
				"cluster.karmada.io/name": "member1",
			},
		}
	},
	]
}
```

The `karmada-search` also supports syncing cached resources to backend stores like [Elasticsearch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticsearch)
or [OpenSearch](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch). By leveraging the search engine, you can perform 
full-text searches with all desired features, by field, and by indice; rank results by score, sort results by field, and aggregate results.


#### Resource Interpreter Webhook enhancement
Introduced `InterpretStatus` for the `Resource Interpreter Webhook` framework, which enables customized resource status collection.

Karmada can thereby learn how to collect status for your resources, especially custom resources. For example, a custom resource 
may have many status fields and only Karmada can collect only those you want.

Refer to [Customizing Resource Interpreter](../../docs/userguide/customizing-resource-interpreter.md) for more details.


#### Integrating verification with the ecosystem
Benefiting from the Kubernetes native APIs, Karmada can easily integrate the Kubernetes ecosystem. The following components are verified by the Karmada community:

- `Kyverno`: policy engine. Refer to [working with kyverno](../../docs/working-with-kyverno.md) for more details.
- `Gatekeeper`: another policy engine. Refer to [working with gatekeeper](../../docs/working-with-gatekeeper.md) for more details.
- `fluxcd`: GitOps tooling for helm chart. Refer to [working with fluxcd](../../docs/working-with-flux.md) for more details.
