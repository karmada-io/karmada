# v1.1 to v1.2

Follow the [Regular Upgrading Process](./README.md).

## Upgrading Notable Changes

### karmada-controller-manager

The `hpa` controller has been disabled by default now, if you are using this controller, please enable it as per [Configure Karmada controllers](https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/blob/master/docs/userguide/configure-controllers.md#configure-karmada-controllers).

### karmada-aggregated-apiserver

The deprecated flags `--karmada-config` and `--master` in v1.1 have been removed from the codebase.
Please remember to remove the flags `--karmada-config` and `--master` in the `karmada-aggregated-apiserver` deployment yaml.

### karmadactl

We enable `karmadactl promote` command to support AA. For details info, please refer to [1795](https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/pull/1795). 

In order to use AA by default, need to deploy some RBAC by following manifests.
