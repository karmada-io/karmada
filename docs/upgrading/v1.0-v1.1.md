# v1.0 to v1.1

Follow the [Regular Upgrading Process](./README.md).

## Upgrading Notable Changes

The validation process for `Cluster` objects now has been moved from `karmada-webhook` to `karmada-aggregated-apiserver` 
by [PR 1152](https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/pull/1152), you have to remove the `Cluster` webhook configuration 
from `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration`, such as:

Otherwise, when joining clusters(or updating Cluster objects) the request will be rejected with following errors:
```
Error: failed to create cluster(host) object. error: Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook "cluster.karmada.io": the server could not find the requested resource
```

Please refer to [v1.1.0 Release Notes](https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/releases/tag/v1.1.0) for more details.
