# Karmada Workload Affinity / Anti-Affinity Support

## Summary

In Kubernetes, it is possible to define pod-level anti-affinity which will cause K8s to schedule pods to run on different nodes. This can be useful in cases where users want to ensure high availability. In Karmada, the same sort of behavior would be useful when trying to guarantee that separately deployed but related workloads are scheduled on different clusters.

This proposal describes the problem statement, the desired final behavior, as well as the required api and code-level changes.

## Motivation

Karmada's PropagationPolicy API already provides pretty fine-grained scheduling configurations, allowing users to set different replica scheduling strategies, spread constraints, and define cluster affinity rules. However, in cases in which users may want to ensure related workloads to exist in different clusters, or in cases in which users may want guarantee multiple workloads are scheduled to the same cluster, these settings are not enough.

### Goals

- Extend the Propagation Policy API to support workload affinity and anti-affinity based scheduling rules.
- Provide a way for users who want HA for their data processing pipelines (or other workloads) with anti-affinity.
- Provide a solution for users who need workloads to be colocated and scheduled to the same clusters.

## Proposal

This proposal extends the PropagationPolicy API to provide support for workload affinity and anti-affinity scheduling rules. Upon scheduling, Karmada will be able to filter feasible clusters based on the workload's affinity and anti-affinity preferences.

This proposal is divided into several steps, see below:

- [ ] `PropagationPolicy` API changes to add `workloadAntiAffinity` and `workloadAffinity` fields
- [ ] `ClusterInfo` and `ClusterSnapshot` enhancements to include affinity metadata
- [ ] Scheduler changes required to support affinity rules
- [ ] Addition of affinity / anti-affinity filter plugins

### User Stories

#### Story 1: Anti-Affinity with FlinkDeployments

As a user of Apache Flink, there may be cases where my data pipeline is has a very low tolerance for downtime (e.g. the job cannot stop processing data for more than a couple seconds). In cases like this I cannot rely on Karmada's cluster failover feature alone since by the time Karmada is able to reschedule my application, the downstream consumers will already have gaps in their data. The solution is to run two duplicate processing pipelines for HA purposes, allowing time for Karmada to schedule the impacted application while the other continues processing.

Karmada should support being able to schedule these types of duplicate pipelines, by making sure that the applications are never scheduled to the same cluster (which would break HA gaurantees).

In the picture below, we can see two workloads which represent two duplicate pipelines scheduled for HA purposes. Karmada will make sure that during the scheduling phase, it will not schedule the application to a cluster if a workload with a `karmada.io/group` label and matching key exists:

#### Story 2: Affinity with Distributed Training Workloads

For very large training jobs, a user may start to run into memory and batch size limits where datasets don't fit into a single worker's GPU memory. As a result, the user may want to shard the training data using multiple smaller training jobs.

These jobs would be applied to Karmada, and the Karmada scheduler should be able to handle scheduling these jobs to the same cluster using affinity rules.

#### Story 3: Affinity for Co-located Applications

There may be cases in which users want to schedule workloads to the same cluster to minimize latency by avoiding cross-cluster network hops between services. Some examples of such as case could be:

- A FlinkDeployment with Kafka Consumers (for ultra-low latency requirements)
- A RayService that relies on RedisCluster for caching (colocated prevents cross-cluster network hops)

## API Changes

In order to support workload affinity / anti-affinity, we will need to make changes to the PropagationPolicy API spec. We will be borrowing the concept of pod affinity and anti-affinity from Kubernetes to create an analogous behavior on a workload level.

### PropagationPolicy

```golang
// Placement represents the rule for select clusters.
type Placement struct {

  // WorkloadAntiAffinity represents the inter-workload anti-affinity scheduling policies.
  // +optional
  WorkloadAntiAffinity *WorkloadAntiAffinity `json:"workloadAntiAffinity,omitempty"`

  // WorkloadAffinity represents the inter-workload affinity scheduling policies.
  // +optional
  WorkloadAffinity *WorkloadAffinity `json:"workloadAffinity,omitempty"`
}
```

### WorkloadAntiAffinity

```golang
// WorkloadAntiAffinity represents inter-workload *anti-affinity* scheduling rules.
type WorkloadAntiAffinity struct {
    // Hard requirements (all terms must be satisfied).
    // Karmada will filter out clusters that do not satisfy WorkloadAffinityTerm during workload scheduling time.
    // +optional
    RequiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution []WorkloadAffinityTerm `json:"requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution,omitempty"`

    // Soft preferences (Karmada will select clusters with a higher total weight).
    // Scheduler *prefers* clusters that satisfy the terms but may choose others.
    // +optional
    PreferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution []WeightedWorkloadAffinityTerm `json:"preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution,omitempty"`
}
```

### WorkloadAffinity

```golang
// WorkloadAffinity represents inter-workload *affinity* scheduling rules.
type WorkloadAffinity struct {
    // Hard requirements (all terms must be satisfied).
    // Karmada will filter out clusters that do not satisfy WorkloadAffinityTerm during workload scheduling time.
    // +optional
    RequiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution []WorkloadAffinityTerm `json:"requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution,omitempty"`

    // Soft preferences (Karmada will select clusters with a higher total weight).
    // Scheduler *prefers* clusters that satisfy the terms but may choose others.
    // +optional
    PreferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution []WeightedWorkloadAffinityTerm `json:"preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution,omitempty"`
}
```

### WorkloadAffinityTerm + WeightedWorkloadAffinityTerm

```golang
// WorkloadAffinityTerm selects a set of peer workloads and defines the co-location
// domain used to evaluate inter-workload affinity / anti-affinity.
//
// Peer Selection:
// - Scope to the union of `namespaces` and `namespaceSelector`
//   (if both empty, use this workload’s namespace).
// - Match `labelSelector`.
// - Additionally, for each key in `matchLabelKeys`, peers must have the same
//   label value as this workload.
//
// Evaluation:
// - For affinity: a candidate cluster is preferred/required if its `topologyKey`
//   value equals that of any peer.
// - For anti-affinity: a candidate cluster is penalized/rejected if its
//   `topologyKey` value equals that of any peer.
//
// Co-location is defined by the cluster label named in `topologyKey`.
type WorkloadAffinityTerm struct {

  // A label query over a set of resources, in this case workloads.
  // If it's null, this WorkloadAffinityTerm matches with no workload.
  // +optional
  LabelSelector *metav1.LabelSelector `json:"labelSelector,omitempty"`

  // AND with LabelSelector, but values come from THIS workload’s labels.
  // e.g., ["ha.karmada.io/group"] → match workloads sharing the same group value.
  // +optional
  MatchLabelKeys []string `json:"matchLabelKeys,omitempty"`

  // Namespaces specifies a static list of namespace names that the term applies to.
  // The term is applied to the union of the namespaces listed in this field
  // and the ones selected by namespaceSelector.
  // null or empty namespaces list and null namespaceSelector means "this workload's namespace".
  // +optional
  Namespaces []string `json:"namespaces,omitempty"`

  // A label query over the set of namespaces that the term applies to.
  // The term is applied to the union of the namespaces selected by this field
  // and the ones listed in the namespaces field.
  // null selector and null or empty namespaces list means "this workload's namespace".
  // An empty selector ({}) matches all namespaces.
  // +optional
  NamespaceSelector *metav1.LabelSelector `json:"namespaceSelector,omitempty"`

  // Cluster label key defining the co-location domain (e.g., topology.karmada.io/cluster|zone|region).
  // +required
  TopologyKey string `json:"topologyKey,omitempty"`
}

// WeightedWorkloadAffinityTerm is a preferred (soft) term with a weight.
// Reused for both Affinity and Anti-Affinity.
type WeightedWorkloadAffinityTerm struct {
    // Weight in [1,100]. Higher = stronger preference.
    // +kubebuilder:validation:Minimum=1
    // +kubebuilder:validation:Maximum=100
    Weight int32 `json:"weight"`

    // The underlying selection/placement term.
    Term WorkloadAffinityTerm `json:"term"`
}
```

An example of anti-affinity usage in the PropagationPolicy could be:

```yaml
apiVersion: policy.karmada.io/v1alpha1
kind: PropagationPolicy
metadata:
  name: ha-flink-deployment
  namespace: user-namespace
spec:
  resourceSelectors:
  - apiVersion: flink.apache.org/v1beta1
    kind: FlinkDeployment
  placement:
    workloadAntiAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        - labelSelector:
            matchLabels:
              app.tier: "prod"
          matchLabelKeys:                # equality on *this* workload’s label values
            - karmada.io/group           # e.g., indexer-job, aggregator-job
          topologyKey: topology.karmada.io/cluster
```

Where the Karmada scheduler will:

1. Select workloads that have `app.tier: "prod"` label AND have the same value of `karmada.io/group` label as this workload.
2. For those workloads, collect their clusters’ topologyKey values.
3. Since we are using `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`, we have defined `hard` requirements. Karmada will exclude feasible clusters whose topologyKey value is in that set.

In general, we can think of the WorkloadAffinityTerm and WeightedWorkloadAffinityTerms as hard vs. soft scheduling requirements. Where:

- **Required terms first**: Filter out unfeasible clusters.
- **Preferred terms next**: Rely on plugins to score clusters depending on WorkloadAffinityTerms.

## Code Changes

In order to support workload anti-affinity (and workload affinity if needed), we’ll need to make some changes to ClusterInfo and ClusterSnapshot, changes to the scheduler to update snapshots and pick up anti-affinity information, and finally create a filter plugin that will check for workload anti-affinity requirements.

### 1. Changes to ClusterInfo

[ClusterInfo](https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/blob/master/pkg/scheduler/framework/types.go#L36) currently only includes the Cluster object itself. In order for the ClusterSnapshot to be able to track clusters that have workloads with anti-affinity rules scheduled on them, we will need to expand the ClusterInfo definition with some more metadata:

BindingsWithRequiredAntiAffinity []*ResourceBinding

Since the Placement within PropagationPolicy has been updated, the ResourceBinding spec will have direct access to the related anti-affinity rules.

### 2. Changes to ClusterSnapshot

The [cluster snapshot](https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/blob/master/pkg/scheduler/cache/snapshot.go#L30) currently only includes a clusterInfoList, which is used by the scheduler when determining the list of feasible clusters. In order for the scheduler to be able to filter out clusters that may not be feasible due to violations in anti-affinity rules, we need to start keeping a list of clusters with anti-affinity workloads.

In order to make updates more efficient, we will need a clusterInfoMap which will have faster clusterInfo retrieval. In Kubernetes, the NodeSnapshot (analogous to our ClusterSnapshot) is implemented using a doubly-linked list, which allows for quick retrievals but also ensures a way to track which nodes have been updated since the last snapshot. We can reuse this idea with our ClusterSnapshot - maintaining a generation for each ClusterInfo, so that when we update we only update until clusterinfo.Generation <= snapshotGeneration.

In addition, we still need to handle how to keep track of cluster additions or updates. We currently have Add/Update/DeleteCluster methods [within the cluster cache](https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/blob/master/pkg/scheduler/cache/cache.go#L49). But these are unused because we simply rely on the ClusterLister to fetch all clusters during each scheduling cycle, ensuring that they are up to date.

### 3. Changes to Scheduler

The Karmada scheduler currently only includes an [internal cache](https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/blob/master/pkg/scheduler/core/generic_scheduler.go#L51) and [generates the cluster snapshot](https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/blob/master/pkg/scheduler/core/generic_scheduler.go#L76) on the fly (using a ClusterLister). To support anti-affinity and to keep the process efficient, we should include the ClusterSnapshot as an attribute of the scheduler object.

When a new scheduler cycle begins, we will update existing ClusterSnapshot with any potential updates that occurred to the clusters.

### 4. Addition of Workload Affinity Filter Plugin

This feature will require the addition of a filter plugin which will filter out clusters that violate the pending workload’s affinity or anti-affinity rules or the rules of one of the workloads currently on the cluster.

For anti-affinity, the filter plugin will check each cluster and determine if the cluster satisfiesWorkloadAntiAffinity by verifying that the cluster matches the topologyKey, and that the pending workload is not conflicting with the anti-affinity counts of any workloads already on the cluster.

We can consider a prefilter step which could compile the antiAffinityCounts before we run the filter plugin.
