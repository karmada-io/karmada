                  the `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation (simple constant name)
                  was never formally defined, it was widely supported by Ingress controllers
                  to create a direct binding between Ingress controller and Ingress
                  resources. Newly created Ingress resources should prefer using the
                  field. However, even though the annotation is officially deprecated,
                  for backwards compatibility reasons, ingress controllers should
                  still honor that annotation if present.

                        from the \"host\" part of the URI as defined in RFC 3986:
                        1. IPs are not allowed. Currently an IngressRuleValue can
                        only apply to the IP in the Spec of the parent Ingress. 2.
                        The `:` delimiter is not respected because ports are not allowed.
                        Currently the port of an Ingress is implicitly :80 for http
                        and :443 for https. Both these may change in the future. Incoming
                        requests are matched against the host before the IngressRuleValue.
                        If the host is unspecified, the Ingress routes all traffic
                        based on the specified IngressRuleValue. \n Host can be \"precise\"
                        which is a domain name without the terminating dot of a network

                        name prefixed with a single wildcard label (e.g. \"*.foo.com\").
                        The wildcard character '*' must appear by itself as the first
                        DNS label and matches only a single label. You cannot have
                        a wildcard label by itself (e.g. Host == \"*\"). Requests
                        will be matched against the Host field in the following way:
                        1. If Host is precise, the request matches this rule if the
                        http host header is equal to Host. 2. If Host is a wildcard,
                        then the request matches this rule if the http host header
                        is to equal to the suffix (removing the first label) of the
                        wildcard rule."
