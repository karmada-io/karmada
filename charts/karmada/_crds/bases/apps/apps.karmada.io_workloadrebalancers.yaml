              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
              may reject unrecognized values.

                  TTLSecondsAfterFinished limits the lifetime of a WorkloadRebalancer that has finished execution (means each
                  target workload is finished with result of Successful or Failed).
                  If this field is set, ttlSecondsAfterFinished after the WorkloadRebalancer finishes, it is eligible to be automatically deleted.
                  If this field is unset, the WorkloadRebalancer won't be automatically deleted.
                  If this field is set to zero, the WorkloadRebalancer becomes eligible to be deleted immediately after it finishes.
