          ClusterTaintPolicy automates taint management on Cluster objects based
          on declarative conditions.
          The system evaluates AddOnConditions to determine when to add taints,
          and RemoveOnConditions to determine when to remove taints.
          AddOnConditions are evaluated before RemoveOnConditions.
          Taints are NEVER automatically removed when the ClusterTaintPolicy is deleted.
