        description: FederatedHPA is centralized HPA that can aggregate the metrics
          in multiple clusters. When the system load increases, it will query the
          metrics from multiple clusters and scales up the replicas. When the system
          load decreases, it will query the metrics from multiple clusters and scales
          down the replicas. After the replicas are scaled up/down, karmada-scheduler
          will schedule the replicas based on the policy.
