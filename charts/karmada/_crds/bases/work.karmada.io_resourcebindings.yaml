                      second group will only be considered in case of the main group
                      does not satisfy restrictions(like, lack of resources). \n Potential
                      use case 2: For the disaster recovery scenario, the clusters
                      could be organized to primary and backup groups, the workloads
                      would be scheduled to primary clusters firstly, and when primary
                      cluster fails(like data center power off), Karmada scheduler
