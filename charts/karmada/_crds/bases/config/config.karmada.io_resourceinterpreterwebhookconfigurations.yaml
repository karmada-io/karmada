              description: ResourceInterpreterWebhook describes the webhook as well
                as the resources and operations it applies to.
              properties:
                clientConfig:
                  description: |-
                    ClientConfig defines how to communicate with the hook.
                    It supports two mutually exclusive configuration modes:

                    1. URL - Directly specify the webhook URL with format `scheme://host:port/path`.
                       Example: https://webhook.example.com:8443/my-interpreter

                    2. Service - Reference a Kubernetes Service that exposes the webhook.
                       When using Service reference, Karmada resolves the endpoint through following steps:
                       a) First attempts to locate the Service in karmada-apiserver
                       b) If found, constructs URL based on Service type:
                          - ClusterIP/LoadBalancer/NodePort: Uses ClusterIP with port from Service spec
                            (Note: Services with ClusterIP "None" are rejected), Example:
                            `https://<cluster ip>:<port>`
                          - ExternalName: Uses external DNS name format: `https://<external name>:<port>`
                       c) If NOT found in karmada-apiserver, falls back to standard Kubernetes
                          service DNS name format: `https://<service>.<namespace>.svc:<port>`

                    Note: When both URL and Service are specified, the Service reference takes precedence
                          and the URL configuration will be ignored.

                        `service` or `url` must be specified.

                        If the webhook is running within the cluster, then you should use `service`.

                            `port` should be a valid port number (1-65535, inclusive).

                    url:
                      description: |-
                        `url` gives the location of the webhook, in standard URL form
                        (`scheme://host:port/path`). Exactly one of `url` or `service`
                        must be specified.

                        The `host` should not refer to a service running in the cluster; use
                        the `service` field instead. The host might be resolved via external
                        DNS in some apiservers (e.g., `kube-apiserver` cannot resolve
                        in-cluster DNS as that would be a layering violation). `host` may
                        also be an IP address.

                        Please note that using `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` as a `host` is
                        risky unless you take great care to run this webhook on all hosts
                        which run an apiserver which might need to make calls to this
                        webhook. Such installs are likely to be non-portable, i.e., not easy
                        to turn up in a new cluster.

                        The scheme must be "https"; the URL must begin with "https://".

                        A path is optional, and if present may be any string permissible in
                        a URL. You may use the path to pass an arbitrary string to the
                        webhook, for example, a cluster identifier.

                        Attempting to use a user or basic auth e.g. "user:password@" is not
                        allowed. Fragments ("#...") and query parameters ("?...") are not
                        allowed, either.

                    supported by Karmada, validation will fail for this object.
                    If a persisted webhook configuration specifies allowed versions and does not
                    include any versions known to the Karmada, calls to the webhook will fail
                    and be subject to the failure policy.
