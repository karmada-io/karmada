          MultiClusterIngress is a collection of rules that allow inbound connections to reach the
          endpoints defined by a backend. The structure of MultiClusterIngress is same as Ingress,
          indicates the Ingress in multi-clusters.

                  formally defined, it was widely supported by Ingress controllers to create
                  a direct binding between Ingress controller and Ingress resources. Newly
                  created Ingress resources should prefer using the field. However, even
                  though the annotation is officially deprecated, for backwards compatibility
                  reasons, ingress controllers should still honor that annotation if present.

                                  pathType determines the interpretation of the path matching. PathType can
                                  be one of the following values:
                                  * Exact: Matches the URL path exactly.
                                  * Prefix: Matches based on a URL path prefix split by '/'. Matching is
                                    done on a path element by element basis. A path element refers is the
                                    list of labels in the path split by the '/' separator. A request is a
                                    match for path p if every p is an element-wise prefix of p of the
                                    request path. Note that if the last element of the path is a substring
                                    of the last element in request path, it is not a match (e.g. /foo/bar
                                    matches /foo/bar/baz, but does not match /foo/barbaz).
                                  * ImplementationSpecific: Interpretation of the Path matching is up to
                                    the IngressClass. Implementations can treat this as a separate PathType
                                    or treat it identically to Prefix or Exact path types.
                                  Implementations are required to support all path types.

                  through the SNI TLS extension, if the ingress controller fulfilling the
