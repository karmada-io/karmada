                      order they appear in the spec, the group that does not satisfy
                      scheduling restrictions will be ignored which means all clusters

                      any cluster can be scheduling candidates. \n Potential use case
                      1: The private clusters in the local data center could be the
                      main group, and the managed clusters provided by cluster providers
                      could be the secondary group. So that the Karmada scheduler
                      would prefer to schedule workloads to the main group and the
                      second group will only be considered in case of the main group
                      does not satisfy restrictions(like, lack of resources). \n Potential
                      use case 2: For the disaster recovery scenario, the clusters
                      could be organized to primary and backup groups, the workloads
                      would be scheduled to primary clusters firstly, and when primary
                      cluster fails(like data center power off), Karmada scheduler
                      could migrate workloads to the backup clusters."
