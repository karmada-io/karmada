  # One of 'readonly' and 'vendor'.
  #  - readonly: the go command is disallowed from the implicit automatic updating of go.mod described above.
  #              Instead, it fails when any changes to go.mod are needed. This setting is most useful to check
  #              that go.mod does not need updates, such as in a continuous integration and testing system.
  #  - vendor: the go command assumes that the vendor directory holds the correct copies of dependencies and ignores
  #            the dependency descriptions in go.mod.
