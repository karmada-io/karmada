	 * Order should return a constant int value. Smaller int value means higher priority.
	 *
	 * # Why order matters?
	 *
	 * The proxy plugin framework uses a variant of "Chain of Responsibility Pattern".
	 * There will be only one plugin selected. Smaller order value means this plugin has the chance to
	 * handle the request first. Only if the preceding plugin decide to not process the request,
	 * the next plugin can have the chance to process it.
	 *
	 * # Pattern Language Explanation
	 *
	 * "Chain of Responsibility Pattern" From "Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software"
	 *
	 *     Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance
	 *     to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until
	 *     an object handles it.
	 *
	 * "Pipes and Filters Pattern" From "Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture Vol.1"
	 *
	 *     The Pipes and Filters architectural pattern provides a structure for systems that process
	 *     a stream of data. Each processing step is encapsulated in a filter component. Data is passed
	 *     through pipes between adjacent filters. Recombining filters allows you to build families of
	 *     related systems.
	 *
	 * Note the difference between "Chain of Responsibility Pattern" and "Pipes and Filters Pattern".
	 * Some other plugin frameworks in kubernetes use "Pipes and Filters Pattern",
	 * they will run multiple filters all together, so the order may not be as important as in
	 * "Chain of Responsibility Pattern"
