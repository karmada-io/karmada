	// Retention describes the desired behavior that Karmada should react on
	// the changes made by member cluster components. This avoids system
	// running into a meaningless loop that Karmada resource controller and
	// the member cluster component continually applying opposite values of a field.
	// For example, the "replicas" of Deployment might be changed by the HPA
	// controller on member cluster. In this case, Karmada should retain the "replicas"
	// and not try to change it.

	// replica as well as resource requirements.
	// It would be useful for those CRD resources that declare workload types like
	// Deployment.
	// It is usually not needed for Kubernetes native resources(Deployment, Job) as
	// Karmada knows how to discover info from them. But if it is set, the built-in
	// discovery rules will be ignored.

	// ComponentResource describes the rules for Karmada to discover the resource requirements
	// for multiple components from the given object.
	// This is designed for CRDs with multiple components (e.g., FlinkDeployment), but
	// can also be used for single-component resources like Deployment.
	// If implemented, the controller will use this to obtain per-component replica and resource
	// requirements, and will not call ReplicaResource.
	// If not implemented, the controller will fall back to ReplicaResource for backward compatibility.
	// This will only be used when the feature gate 'MultiplePodTemplatesScheduling' is enabled.

	// It would be useful for those CRD resources that declare workload types like
