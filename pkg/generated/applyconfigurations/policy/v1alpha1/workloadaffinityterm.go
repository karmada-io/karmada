// specific workload groups.

	// determines the affinity group. Workloads with the same label value under
	// this key belong to the same affinity group.

	// The scheduler maintains a global index of affinity groups in memory for
	// efficient lookup. Each affinity group is identified by a serialized
	// key-value pair and contains all workload resource templates that belong
	// to the group.

	// "app.group=frontend" will form one affinity group, while those with
	// "app.group=backend" will form another.
