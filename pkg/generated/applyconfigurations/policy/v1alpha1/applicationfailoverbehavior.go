	// When an application fails over from one cluster to another, this policy enables
	// the extraction of critical data from the original resource configuration.
	// Upon successful migration, the extracted data is then re-injected into the new
	// resource, ensuring that the application can resume operation with its previous
	// state intact.
	// This is particularly useful for stateful applications where maintaining data
	// consistency across failover events is crucial.
	// If not specified, means no state data will be preserved.

	// Note: This requires the StatefulFailoverInjection feature gate to be enabled,
	// which is alpha.
