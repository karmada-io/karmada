// FieldOverrider represents the rules dedicated to modifying a specific field in any Kubernetes resource.
// This allows changing a single field within the resource with multiple operations.
// It is designed to handle structured field values such as those found in ConfigMaps or Secrets.
// The current implementation supports JSON and YAML formats, but can easily be extended to support XML in the future.
// Note: In any given instance, FieldOverrider processes either JSON or YAML fields, but not both simultaneously.
