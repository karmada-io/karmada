// WorkloadAntiAffinityTerm defines anti-affinity rules for separating workloads
// from specific workload groups.

	// GroupByLabelKey declares the label key on the workload resource template that
	// determines the anti-affinity group. Workloads with the same label value under
	// this key belong to the same anti-affinity group and will be separated.

	// The scheduler maintains a global index of affinity groups in memory for
	// efficient lookup. Each affinity group is identified by a serialized
	// key-value pair and contains all workload resource templates that belong
	// to the group.

	// as part of the same group.

	// Example: If GroupByLabelKey is "app.group", workloads with the label
	// "app.group=frontend" will avoid clusters where other
	// "app.group=frontend" workloads already exist.
