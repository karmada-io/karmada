	// ClusterAffinities represents scheduling restrictions to multiple cluster
	// groups that indicated by ClusterAffinityTerm.
	//
	// The scheduler will evaluate these groups one by one in the order they
	// appear in the spec, the group that does not satisfy scheduling restrictions
	// will be ignored which means all clusters in this group will not be selected
	// unless it also belongs to the next group(a cluster could belong to multiple
	// groups).
	//
	// If none of the groups satisfy the scheduling restrictions, then scheduling
	// fails, which means no cluster will be selected.

	// 2. If both ClusterAffinity and ClusterAffinities are not set, any cluster

	//
	// Potential use case 1:
	// The private clusters in the local data center could be the main group, and
	// the managed clusters provided by cluster providers could be the secondary
	// group. So that the Karmada scheduler would prefer to schedule workloads
	// to the main group and the second group will only be considered in case of
	// the main group does not satisfy restrictions(like, lack of resources).
	//
	// Potential use case 2:
	// For the disaster recovery scenario, the clusters could be organized to
	// primary and backup groups, the workloads would be scheduled to primary
	// clusters firstly, and when primary cluster fails(like data center power off),
	// Karmada scheduler could migrate workloads to the backup clusters.
