// WorkloadAffinityGroupsApplyConfiguration represents a declarative configuration of the WorkloadAffinityGroups type for use
// with apply.
//
// WorkloadAffinityGroups stores the instantiated affinity and anti-affinity group names.
// Each group name is serialized as "<labelKey>=<labelValue>" (for example: "app.group=frontend"),
// and is used by the scheduler to co-locate workloads in the same affinity group and to separate
// workloads in the same anti-affinity group.
// Note: If multiple groups are needed later, prefer adding list-typed fields (e.g., AffinityGroups,
// AntiAffinityGroups) alongside these fields to keep backward compatibility.
