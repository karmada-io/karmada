// ResourceModelRangeApplyConfiguration represents a declarative configuration of the ResourceModelRange type for use
// with apply.
//
// ResourceModelRange describes the detail of each modeling quota that ranges from min to max.
// Please pay attention, by default, the value of min can be inclusive, and the value of max cannot be inclusive.
// E.g. in an interval, min = 2, max = 10 is set, which means the interval [2,10).
// This rule ensures that all intervals have the same meaning. If the last interval is infinite,
// it is definitely unreachable. Therefore, we define the right interval as the open interval.
// For a valid interval, the value on the right is greater than the value on the left,
// in other words, max must be greater than min.
// It is strongly recommended that the [Min, Max) of all ResourceModelRanges can make a continuous interval.
