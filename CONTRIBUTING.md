# Before you get started

## Code of Conduct

Please make sure to read and observe our [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Community Expectations

Karmada is a community project driven by its community which strives to promote a healthy, friendly and productive environment.
Karmada aims to provide turnkey automation for multi-cluster application management in multi-cloud and hybrid cloud scenarios, 
and intended to realize multi-cloud centralized management, high availability, failure recovery and traffic scheduling.

# Getting started

- Fork the repository on GitHub.
- Make your changes on your fork repository.
- Submit a PR.


# Your First Contribution

We will help you to contribute in different areas like filing issues, developing features, fixing critical bugs and 
getting your work reviewed and merged.

If you have questions about the development process, 
feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/issues/new/choose).

## Find something to work on

We are always in need of help, be it fixing documentation, reporting bugs or writing some code.
Look at places where you feel best coding practices aren't followed, code refactoring is needed or tests are missing.
Here is how you get started.

### Find a good first topic

There are [multiple repositories](https://github.com/karmada-io/) within the Karmada organization.
Each repository has beginner-friendly issues that provide a good first issue.
For example, [karmada-io/karmada](https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada) has 
[help wanted](https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) and 
[good first issue](https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) 
labels for issues that should not need deep knowledge of the system.
We can help new contributors who wish to work on such issues.

Another good way to contribute is to find a documentation improvement, such as a missing/broken link. 
Please see [Contributing](#contributing) below for the workflow.

#### Work on an issue

When you are willing to take on an issue, just reply on the issue. The maintainer will assign it to you.

### File an Issue

While we encourage everyone to contribute code, it is also appreciated when someone reports an issue.
Issues should be filed under the appropriate Karmada sub-repository.

*Example:* a Karmada issue should be opened to [karmada-io/karmada](https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/issues).

Please follow the prompted submission guidelines while opening an issue.

# Contributor Workflow

Please do not ever hesitate to ask a question or send a pull request.

This is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:

- Create a topic branch from where to base the contribution. This is usually master.
- Make commits of logical units.
- Push changes in a topic branch to a personal fork of the repository.
- Submit a pull request to [karmada-io/karmada](https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada).

## Creating Pull Requests

Pull requests are often called simply "PR".
Karmada generally follows the standard [github pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) process.
To submit a proposed change, please develop the code/fix and add new test cases.
After that, run these local verifications before submitting pull request to predict the pass or
fail of continuous integration.

* Run and pass `make verify`
* Run and pass `make test`

## Code Review

To make it easier for your PR to receive reviews, consider the reviewers will need you to:

* follow [good coding guidelines](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments).
* write [good commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
* break large changes into a logical series of smaller patches which individually make easily understandable changes, and in aggregate solve a broader issue.
